egional Sales Data Analysis
Overview

This project analyzes historical U.S. regional sales data to understand revenue performance, profitability, seasonality, and customer behavior. The goal is to turn raw sales data into clear insights and an interactive dashboard that supports better commercial and regional decision-making.

The analysis is based on five years of sales history and focuses on identifying growth opportunities across regions, products, customers, and sales channels.


PPT --- Regional Sales Analysis

Business Context

Sales performance varies widely by region, product, and channel. Without a consolidated view, it becomes difficult to:

Understand seasonal revenue swings

Identify top-performing products and customers

Evaluate channel-level profitability

Allocate resources effectively across regions

This project addresses those gaps through structured analysis and visualization.

Objectives

Evaluate regional and state-level sales performance

Identify seasonal patterns and revenue trends

Analyze product, customer, and channel profitability

Highlight key drivers of revenue and margin

Provide a self-service dashboard for ongoing analysis

Data Preparation

The raw data consisted of multiple independent tables covering:

Sales transactions

Products

Customers

Budgets

Regions and states

Before analysis, the data was cleaned and consolidated:

Tables were joined into a single analytical dataset

Column names were standardized

Redundant fields were removed

New metrics were created, including profit and profit margin

No missing values or duplicate records were identified.

Analysis Summary

Key areas of analysis included:

Monthly and yearly sales trends

Product revenue and margin performance

Sales channel contribution and profitability

Geographic performance by state and region

Customer revenue concentration and segmentation

Correlation analysis of pricing, cost, quantity, and profit

Key Findings

Sales show clear seasonality, with weaker performance early in the year and peaks in late spring and early summer

A small number of products account for a large share of total revenue

Wholesale drives the majority of sales volume, while Export delivers stronger margins

California is the strongest state by both revenue and order volume

Revenue is heavily concentrated among a small group of customers

Pricing has a much stronger impact on profit than order quantity

Recommendations

Strengthen promotions during low-performing months to reduce seasonality risk

Focus investment on top-performing products and reassess low-margin SKUs

Expand high-margin Export channels while maintaining Wholesale volume

Apply successful regional strategies from California to other regions

Monitor large accounts with lower margins and review pricing or cost structures

Dashboard

An interactive dashboard was built to support ongoing analysis and decision-making. It includes:

Overall performance and trend summaries

Customer segmentation by revenue and margin

Revenue scenarios for planning and forecasting

Tools & Technologies

Data analysis and cleaning

Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Business intelligence dashboarding (Power BI)

Project Outcome

The project delivers a complete analytical workflow—from raw data to insights and visualization—enabling stakeholders to explore sales performance independently and make informed, data-driven decisions.
